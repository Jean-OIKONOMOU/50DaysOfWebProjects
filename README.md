# 50 Days of Web Projects
I decided to do a web project every day for 50 days. This was for my new year's resolution (2021).

# Project 1 : Expanding UI Cards
This project involves many folded cards that, when you click on one of them, unfolds it slowly, revealing any text and/or image contained within. The cards are folded in such a way that you can see a little preview of the image they contain. Only one card can be unfolded at a time. Made using flexbox and some Javascript.

# Project 2 : Progress Bar
One of the things I've always wanted to build : a progress meter. It's pretty self-explanatory.
